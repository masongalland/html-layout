        <p>Consider hiding the status bar--and all other app
            UI--while people are actively viewing full-screen media.
            If you hide the status bar, be sure to let people retrieve
            it (and the appropriate app UI) with a single tap. Unless
            you have a compelling reason to do so, avoid defining a custom
            gesture to redisplay the status bar because users are unlikely
            to discover such a gesture or to remember it.</p>
